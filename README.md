This repository will be a collection of packages for helping to create graphical programs.
The libraries work at the image level; you are responsible for displaying the images on the screen.
The example program, cmd/buf, is a simple text editor which uses plan9port's devdraw to draw to a window. In theory
it should also work on native Plan 9, but I haven't tested that yet.
