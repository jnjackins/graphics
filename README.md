Libraries for creating graphical programs in Go.

* [text](http://godoc.org/sigint.ca/graphics/text): a library for creating graphical, possibly editable text areas.
* [scrollbar](http://godoc.org/sigint.ca/graphics/scrollbar): a library for attaching scrollbars to scrollable graphical elements.
* cmd/buf: A graphical text editor intended to have similar behavior to [Acme](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/acme/acme.html) or [Sam](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/sam/sam.html), but with less window management. The goal of this program is to exercise the packages in this repository.

All software in this repository is currently work-in-progress. All packages strive to be pure Go, although programs in cmd may require external (non-Go) software.
